                I’m equal parts tech geek and art enthusiast, and I like making things <span class="color-span">more enjoyable</span> for people.
                <br><br>
                Those ‘things’ often revolve around interface design and product development, with a strong emphasis on 
                user experience. Any time I’m able to blend art and technology, I feel right at home.
                <br><br>
                So, what are my strengths then?

                    <br><br>
                    During the 2012-2013 academic year, I worked with six other
                    students to make a Windows 8 application for Hudl, a video
                    software company specializing in tools for athletes and coaches.
                    I served as the lead interface designer on the project, conducting 
                    coach interviews, creating mockups, collaborating with Hudl designers,
                    maintaining a set of design principles for my team's work, and 
                    writing some of the XAML and C# code needed for the interface.
                    We completely redesigned (and partially recoded) the interface twice
                    during development, but in the end, we were definitely proud of what we
                    managed to put together. We even gained a four-star average rating in
                    the app store.

                    <br><br>
                    Over the course of the 2013-2014 academic year, I worked with another
                    student team to design a hospital wayfinding system for HDR. We followed HDR's own
                    Synapse design process, actively scoping the project (and our design principles),
                    empathisizing through core user personas, brainstorming, prototyping, and testing
                    with relevant users. We hit the whiteboards hard, and traveled to
                    several hospitals to get a feel for how confusing navigation can be... 
                    especially when you're not feeling your best. At the end of the project, we had an
                    expansive idea catalogue and several working prototypes that leveraged graphic
                    affordance and digital guidance (via Bluetooth, Android, and Arduino systems).

                    <br><br>
                    During the summer of 2013, I was able to intern at Garmin International
                    in Olathe, Kansas. I served in the outdoor division, working primary on GPS
                    trail watches. In particular, I was tasked with coding temperature-compensated
                    contrast settings for several LCD watch displays and creating a Virtual Partner
                    pacing feature for the Fenix and Tactix watches. Design was primarily conducted
                    via paper mockups, with the feature needing to adhere to existing Garmin standards.
                    After the Virtual Partner was implemented in C, I was able to test it on
                    my own Fenix as I biked around the Garmin campus. It was an awesome experience,
                    and I was very happy that inital feature reviews were positive.

                    At other times, I've put together a few design projects, namely this website
                    and an airport mobile app prototype. I try to put myself into everything I work on,
                    developing an aesthetic that's both appealing and highly functional. One hugely
                    important aspect in acheiving those end results is user testing. Even in my
                    personal projects, I make it a priority to get user feedback - to understand what
                    people think and feel as they walk through my interfaces. It really is about the
                    experience, and that's something I strive to make as enjoyable as possible.
